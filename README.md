Telegram Medical Insights Pipeline
Overview

The Telegram Medical Insights Pipeline is a data engineering project designed to collect, process, and analyze medical-related data from Telegram channels (@CheMed123, @lobelia4cosmetics, @tikvahpharma). The pipeline scrapes messages and images, loads them into a PostgreSQL database, enriches image data with YOLOv8 object detection, transforms data into a star schema using dbt, exposes analytical endpoints via a FastAPI application, and orchestrates the workflow with Dagster for robust scheduling and monitoring.

Prerequisites Python: 3.9+ PostgreSQL: 13+ with database medical_warehouse (user: admin, password: securepassword, host: localhost, port: 5432) Telegram API: API key and hash for scraping YOLOv8: Pre-trained model for image processing dbt: Installed with pip install dbt-postgres Dagster: Installed with pip install dagster, dagster-webserver

Setup Clone the Repository: git clone

pipeline Components
Telegram Scraper (src/telegram_scraper.py):
Scrapes messages and images from @CheMed123, @lobelia4cosmetics, @tikvahpharma. Stores data in data/raw/telegram_messages/<channel_name>.

PostgreSQL Loader (src/load_to_postgres.py):
Loads raw data into raw.telegram_messages and raw.image_detections.

YOLO Enrichment (src/process_images_yolo.py):
Processes images using YOLOv8 to detect medical objects. Stores results in raw.image_detections.

dbt Transformations (medical_warehouse/):
Transforms raw data into a star schema: staging.stg_telegram_messages staging.stg_image_detections marts.dim_channels marts.dim_dates marts.fct_messages marts.fct_image_detections

FastAPI Application (api/):
Exposes endpoints:

GET /api/reports/top-products?limit=10: Top products by mention count.
GET /api/channels/{channel_name}/activity: Channel posting activity.
GET /api/search/messages?query=: Search messages by keyword.
Dagster Orchestration (orchestration/):
Orchestrates the pipeline with ops for scraping, loading, YOLO processing, and dbt transformations.

Run FastAPI:
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
